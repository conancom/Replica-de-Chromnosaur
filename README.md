# Replica-de-Chromnosaur


This game was created to show the capabilities of digital circuitry. [Along side being a submission for my University Subject]





To play the game you simply need to download the main file in the folder, and open it using Logisim, which can be downloaded for free.

- start the simulation.
- clock frequency basically determines difficulty (The higher, the faster, the harder)
- press the only button on the left (hold it for a second to make sure it syncs)
- click on the keyboard input bar to control


W -> Jump; 
S -> Duck


Other files are some testing things.



Additional Notes/Details/Descrptions will be added later on when I have time. 


Enjoy

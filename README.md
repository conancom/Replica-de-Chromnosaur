# Replica-de-Chromnosaur


This game was created to show the capabilities of digital circuitry. [Along side being a submission for my University Subject]





To play the game you simply need to download the main file in the folder, and open it using Logisim, which can be downloaded for free.




Additional Notes/Details/Descrptions will be added later on when I have time. 


Enjoy
